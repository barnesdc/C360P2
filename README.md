Variant of the Unlicense designed specifically for students, addsspecific anti-cheating language to protect students.

When publishing open source code from classes, students can leave themselves open to accusations of aiding others to
cheat, even without knowing their code is being used directly. Therefore, I have modified the Unlicense to include a
clause specifically prohibiting the use of code in academic settings without permission from professors.
